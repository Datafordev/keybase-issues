## Security Bugs

If you are aware of a security bug (or have a proposal/implemention of a "zero day" attack), notifying us privately is in the interest of all users. We can then discuss it post-mortem. To reach us privately, please get our public keys here:

  - https://keybase.io/max
  - https://keybase.io/chris
  
You can import our keys to GPG - and verify our Keybase.io admin status - with `keybase track max` and `keybase track chris`.

## Desktop client bugs

If you've installed Keybase on your desktop, run:

```
keybase log send
```

and follow the instructions

## Mobile app bugs

Please post to https://github.com/keybase/client/issues

## Website bugs, feature suggestions, ideas, etc.

There's an [issues tab](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues) on this page (probably at the top). The direct link:

  - https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues

We appreciate comments, questions, feature requests, etc.

Keybase has a few repos (see below), and we can't expect you to know where to post issues. So post everything here. We'll tag and organize it all.

### If you'd like to review our code

We'd like that too.

  * https://github.com/keybase/client - the client for all platforms
  * https://github.com/keybase/node-client - our older node client
